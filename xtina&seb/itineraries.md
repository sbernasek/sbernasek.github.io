The sections below combine photos, mobile tracking, and activity data to summarize our recent travels. Each map contains a few different things: 
* A heatmap shows where we were. 
* Lines reflect routes we took. Flights are red, trains are green, and drives are black. 
* Red camera icons denote geotagged photos.
* Big red or green circles are clusters of photos taken close together.
* Small green circles describe Seb's hiking endeavours.
* Small black circles summarize Seb's ski days at a particular resort.
* A menu in the top right corner lets you control which of these are shown.

If you're more interested in the big picture, there's also a [composite version]({{ site.map_objs | absolute_url }}/merge.html).
