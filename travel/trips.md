<h1> Travel maps </h1>

We combined our photos and tracking data to summarize our recent trips below. There's also a [composite version]({{ site.map_objs | absolute_url }}/merge.html).

In each map:
* The blue/red shading (heatmap) shows where we were
* Red lines are flights
* Green lines are trains
* Black lines are driving routes

The menu in the top right corner controls which segments of the itinerary are shown.

### Spring 2020
Seb hiked a long way, then we went skiing. When the snow ran out, we drove a long way to find more of it.
