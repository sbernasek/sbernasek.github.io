### Redundancy in gene regulatory networks

During the development of complex organisms, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) integrate external signals to ensure the timely execution of downstream events. These networks exhibit extensive functional redundancy, enabling cells to partially compensate for deleterious mutations. I sought to elucidate evolutionary forces shaping these topologies by identifying additional benefits that redundant regulatory mechanisms confer upon heterogeneous populations of organisms. My collaborators and I coupled model-based predictions with experimental validation in model organisms in an effort to generate and test new hypotheses. We showed that redundant regulatory mechanisms enable faster rates of growth and development by safeguarding against excessive protein expression when metabolic rates are high.

The results implicate a novel driving force in the evolution of genetic circuits. By adding more brakes, organisms can safely upgrade their metabolic engine in order to gain an edge in the race from embryo to adulthood.
