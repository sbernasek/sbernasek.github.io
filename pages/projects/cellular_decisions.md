### Cellular decisions in the developing eye

Transcription factors coordinate the timing and execution of cell differentiation by tuning the expression of target genes. Some transcription factors promote differentiation, while others impede it. Competing transcription factors are often co-expressed *in vivo*, and it remains unclear how cells reliably integrate their antagonistic inputs. I developed and deployed computer vision techniques to infer the expression dynamics of competing transcription factors from confocal microscope images of the developing fruit fly eye. Combined with an experimental pipeline developed by my experimental collaborators, my approach facilitates quantitative modeling and characterization of transcription factor activity both before, during, and after differentiation.
