### Fly-QMA

A python package for automated mosaic analysis of Drosophila imaginal discs. Facilitates high-throughput segmentation, bleedthrough correction, and annotation of raw microscope images in order to accelerate experimental pipelines while improving reproducibility.

### FlyEye Analysis

A python platform for analyzing gene expression measurements obtained using FlyEye Silhouette. Supports dynamic analysis, spatial analysis, model fitting, and visualization of the resultant trends.

### Binding

A python package for simulating the statistical mechanics of cooperative binding events between transcription factors and their target promoters. A recursive, cython-based implementation enables large-scale and highly parallelized enumeration of all possible microstates that would otherwise be computationally intractable.

### Gene SSA

A python framework for exact stochastic simulation of Markov processes, with a particular emphasis on gene regulatory networks. Leverages a cython backend to simulate large networks faster and more efficiently than all other open source tools I've come across.
