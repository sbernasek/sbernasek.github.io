### Fly-QMA

A python framework for automated mosaic analysis of Drosophila imaginal discs. Facilitates high-throughput segmentation, bleedthrough correction, and annotation of raw microscope images in order to accelerate experimental pipelines while increasing reproducibility. [[code](https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/flyqma)]

Check out the [Fly-QMA page](https://www.sbernasek.com/flyqma) for more info.

### Fly-Eye Analysis

A python platform for analyzing gene expression measurements obtained using FlyEye Silhouette. The main purpose of this package is to infer aggregate dynamic behavior by assigning a developmental age to each segmented nucleus using the approach described in our upcoming [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/430744). The package also provides various spatial analysis, model fitting, and visualization methods that are particularly useful for analyzing FlyEye Silhouette data. [[code](https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/flyeye)]

### TF-Binding

A python package for simulating the statistical mechanics of cooperative binding events between transcription factors and their target promoters. A recursive, cython-based implementation enables large-scale and highly parallelized enumeration of all possible microstates that would otherwise be computationally intractable. [[code](https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/binding)]

### Gene SSA

A python framework for exact stochastic simulation of Markov processes, with a particular emphasis on gene regulatory networks. Leverages a cython backend to simulate large networks faster and more efficiently than all other open source tools I've come across. [[code](https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/genessa)]
