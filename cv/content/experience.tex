%		\item {A \emph{\href{https://pypi.org/project/flyqma/}{framework}} for automated analysis of mosaic imaginal discs, that lowers the barrier to high-throughput data collection.}
%		\item {A \emph{\href{https://pypi.org/project/flyeye/}{package}} for analyzing gene expression dynamics in the developing fly eye, that ascribes quantitative rigor to a popular experimental technique.}
%		\item {A \emph{\href{https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/binding}{framework}} for statistical mechanical modeling of transcription factor binding site occupancy, that leverages a novel microstate enumeration algorithm to dramatically outperform the existing state of the art in terms of both memory footprint and simulation scale.}
%		\item {A \emph{\href{https://github.com/sebastianbernasek/genessa}{framework}} for rapid stochastic simulation of large biochemical reaction networks, that outperforms all other available simulation tools for a broad class of reaction networks.}
